### Hints

1. This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!

## Overview

Deja Vu

One can see that the string given in the description _cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}_ seems to match the format of the picoCTF flag; aka _picoCTF{.....}_ albeit that the text is encrypted.

## Steps

1. Apply the ROT13 logic to the first character of the string

```
c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h -> i -> j -> k -> l -> m -> n -> o -> p
```

Woo-hoo; the cipher-text _c_ maps to the plain-text _p_

2. Apply the same logic to the next character - _v_ - which seems to map, as required, to _i_. This definitely seems to be right way to go.

   However, performing the conversion by hand is a little tedious - so let's see if an online tool can help.

3. Using [CyberChef](<https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=ROT13(true,true,false,13)>) provides the complete plaintext quickly and easily.

4. Cut and paste the output into the picoCTF window to gain the credit

```
picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}
```
