1. Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if your answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.


## Overview

Really, 50 points for this? Ok


## Steps

1. So base 2 increments are

      32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

   So we need

       1,  0, 1, 0, 1, 0

   To represent 44(dec)


2. Submit *picoCTF{101010}* into the picoCTF window to gain the credit
