None

### Hints

1. Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was '22', you would submit 'picoCTF{22}' as the flag.


## Overview

Really, another 50 points for this? Ok, I suppose if you didn't know what ASCII was - but still, it's hardly 50 points to figure that out.


## Steps

1. Use an ASCII table to check, so 0x3D is '=' or 61 in decimal

2. Submit *picoCTF{61}* into the picoCTF window to gain the credit
