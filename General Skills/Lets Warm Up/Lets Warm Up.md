### Description

If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?

### Downloads
None

### Hints

1. Submit your answer in our flag format. For example, if your answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.


## Overview

Really, 50 points for this? Ok, I suppose if you didn't know what ASCII was - but still, it's hardly 50 points to figure that out.


## Steps

1. Use an ASCII table to check, but 0x70 is 'p'

2. Submit *picoCTF{p}* into the picoCTF window to gain the credit
