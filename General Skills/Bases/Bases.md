## Overview

Have you been paying attention?


## Steps

1. The string is using A-Za-z0-9 ... so it might well be base 64.
   Using CyberChef with the Base64 recipes confirms that the text decodes to

      *l3arn_th3_r0p35*

   Certainly looks reasonable ... so we wrap with *picoCTf{....}* and submit into picoCTF


2. Yes, it's correct, so we gain the credit
