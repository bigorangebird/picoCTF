### Description

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/ ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44573

### Hints

1. Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's


## Overview

Privilege escalation is great


## Steps

1. First, let's take a look at what the server gives us by loading the link into our browser

2. We get a login form. As expecting, attempting to login by guessing Joe's credentials fails. Using any other credentials gets us logged in, but without sufficient privileges.

3. Guessing at other URIs doesn't seem to fit with the ethos of these challenges - so let's look at the cookies and see if the website is storing authentication information there.

4. Yes they are .... with a valid login, three cookies are created

      username  <entered username>
      password  <entered password>
      admin     False


5. Perhaps we can just change enable admin mode by changing the value of the *admin* cookie to "True"?

   Ooh - yes, that works. Change the value and then use F5 to refresh the page.

   Our challenge flag is displayed on the screen.

6. Cut and paste each part into the picoCTF window to gain the credit.
