- Points 100

### Description

Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830

### Downloads

None

### Hints

1. What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Overview

Bad robots won't have any trouble here.

## Steps

1. First, let's take a look at what the server gives us by loading the link into our browser

2. Not really expecting to see anything on screen - and so we were not disappointed.
   This title suggests that we should look for the _robots.txt_ file

   ```
   User-agent: *
   Disallow: /1bb4c.html
   ```

3. This would tell a well-behaved robot not to look at that file. So let's do just that and use our web-browser to access *https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/1bb4c.html*

   And we get a page displaying the challenge flag

   _picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng*Mach1n3s***\*\***}_

4. We input this into the picoCTF window to gain the credit.
