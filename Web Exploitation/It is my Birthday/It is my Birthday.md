# It is my Birthday

### Description

I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. http://mercury.picoctf.net:57247/

### Hints

1. Look at the category of this problem.

2. How may a PHP site check the rules in the description

## Overview

It's perfectly reasonable that different content produces the same hash-sum.

## Steps

1. We need to submit two files

   - that have different content
   - have the same _md5_ checksum
   - be PDF files

2. Crafting something by hand sounds like a lot of learning .... but searching Google supplies many examples of the same content producing the same md5 hashes.

   I've chosen to use a pair provided by [Marc Stevens](https://marc-stevens.nl/research/md5-1block-collision/)

3. It might be that the challenge needs real PDF files ... but hopefully we'll save a lot of work if the webserver only checks that the file extension is .pdf .... so we'll try that first.

   I renamed the files (which ended .bin) to be .pdf; and then checked the _md5_ values

   ```
   > mv message1.bin message1.pdf
   > mv message2.bin message2.pdf
   > md5 message*
   MD5 (message1.pdf) = 008ee33a9d58b51cfeb425b0959121c9
   MD5 (message2.pdf) = 008ee33a9d58b51cfeb425b0959121c9
   ```

4. Let's upload the files to the website listed in the description and see if it works.
   Yay - that works... and we get a page of source code... and at the end of the PHP source we see our challange flag as a comment.

   _picoCTF{c0ngr4ts*u_r_1nv1t3d***\*\***}_

5. We input this into the picoCTF window to gain the credit.
