### Hints

1. How do you inspect web code on a browser?

2. There's 3 parts


## Overview

The description and hint suggest we will be able to pull the flag from within the source code for this website


## Steps

1. First, let's take a look at what the server gives us by loading the link into our browser

2. Nothing on screen ... so let's fire up the browser dev tools and look at the source code. It's not that complicated, so used 'right-click' to 'expand recursively' so we can see everything

3. At right at the bottom we see a HTML comment

   ```
   <!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
   ```

   Okay - so one down (as per the 2nd hint) and two to go.

3. We can see in the header that two file (myjs.js and mycss.css) are also loaded into this webpage. So let's open those as well.

   Will switch to the 'Sources' tab within the dev tools ..

4. 'mycss.css' contains part 2; again at the bottom of the code

   ```
   /* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
   ```

5. 'myjs.js' contains part 3; also at the bottom

   ```
   /* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?******} */   
   ```

6. Cut and paste each part into the picoCTF window to gain the credit.

  picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?******}
