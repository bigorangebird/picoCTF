### Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/. Can you find it?

### Downloads
None

### Hints

1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.


## Overview

The website looks familiar!


## Steps

1. First, let's take a look at what the server gives us by loading the link into our browser

2. Nothing on screen (again) ... so let's fire up the browser dev tools and look at the source code. It's not that complicated, so used 'right-click' to 'expand recursively' so we can see everything

3. At right at the bottom we see a HTML comment

   ```
   <!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
   ```

   Okay - so one down.

3. Again, we can see in the header that two file (myjs.js and mycss.css) are also loaded into this webpage. So let's open those as well.

   Will switch to the 'Sources' tab within the dev tools ..

4. 'mycss.css' contains part 2; again at the bottom of the code

   ```
   /* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
   ```

5. This time 'myjs.js' doesn't contain part 3; but rather there is a message at the bottom

   ```
   /* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
   ```

6. Search engines *should* ask permission from a website before trying to index it ... and they would do that by looking for the file *robots.txt* in the root of the website. So let's go get that file and see what it says.

  ```
  > wget http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/robots.txt
  > cat robots.txt
  User-agent: *
  Disallow: /index.html
  # Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
  # I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
  ```

  And - oh - there is more that three parts to the flag for this challenge.


7. Hmmm, the fact that the word 'Access' has a capital letter in the latest hint suggests that we might need to see if we can read the .htaccess file somewhere on the website. These should normally not be accessible to visitors - but let's give it a go.

   ```
   > wget wget http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/.htaccess
   > cat .htaccess
    # Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
    # I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
   ```

   Hmm, no closing brace, so it's likely that this isn't all of the flag as yet.
   Again, a hint in the capitalization of the word Store ... and a reference to working on a Mac.

   Mac's use a file .DS_Store to hold information .. so lets see if that is available as well.

   ```
   > wget wget http://mercury.picoctf.net:27278/.DS_Store
   > cat .DS_Store
   Congrats! You completed the scavenger hunt. Part 5: _*****}
   ```

6. So five pieces now need to be pulled together into the picoCTF window to gain the credit.

      *picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c33s_2_lO0k_******}*
