### Hints

1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices

2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses


## Overview

No instructions now - but a suggestion from the title that we need to consider manipulating headers to solve this challenge.


## Steps

1. First, let's take a look at what the server gives us by loading the link.

   Initially I used the *curl* command to take a quick peek, but nothing obvious there other than their being two forms on the page ... with one using POST method to submit; the other using GET; both submitted to the same server URI (index.php)

2. Start a web-browser and load the linked URL. We see two buttons that switch the background colour of the page. Not the way I'd code it, but hey - this isn't real life!

    Checking out the headers in dev tools reveals nothing ... so perhaps we need to look a little more closely at them.

3. Run the command line *curl* command with the -I option to inspect the headers

   ```
   curl -I http://mercury.picoctf.net:53554/
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   flag: picoCTF{r3j3ct_th3_du4l1ty_******}
   Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
   ```

   And we can see the challenge flag returned - yay!


4. Cut and paste the displayed flag into the picoCTF window to gain the credit




### Side Notes

1. Not sure what we'd have gained by using BurpSuite!
