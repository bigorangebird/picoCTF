# picoCTF

A repository for write-ups on my various picoCTF learning activities, including my journey with Kali and similar toolsets.
It's been great fun so far, I hope you'll join in the experience yourself.

You can join in by visiting https://play.picoctf.org

I started this journey using the Kali toolset running in a Virtualbox VM on my Mac.
I'll detail the individual tools used in each of the challenges.

I've included details of any rabbit-holes encountered along the way.

If you are here just looking for the final flag and not in the learning experience, please look elsewhere as I've **NOT** given the obtained flag in full. 
Please please please learn from my learning - you'll benefit more in the end.
